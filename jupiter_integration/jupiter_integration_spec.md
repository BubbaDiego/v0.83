# Jupiter Integration Module

This folder contains stubbed components for future integration with the
[Jupiter](https://docs.jup.ag/) exchange. The goal is to automate
perpetual futures workflows and provide command line entry points.

```
jupiter_integration/
├── playwright/         # Browser automation helpers
├── anchorpy_client/    # AnchorPy based client utilities
└── console_apps/       # CLI wrappers for running flows
```

Each subpackage exposes placeholder classes so imports succeed while
implementation is in progress.
