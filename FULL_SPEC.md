# System Specifications Index

This repository contains multiple subsystems that make up the overall trading and monitoring platform.  Each module has its own specification document with details on structure and responsibilities. This index provides a high level summary and links to the individual specs.

## Modules

### Cyclone
The Cyclone module drives workflow orchestration and alert management. It processes market updates, evaluates portfolio risk and positions, generates alerts, and coordinates hedging logic.
For a focused look at the main engine see the [Cyclone Core specification](cyclone/cyclone_core_spec.md).

### Positions
The [Positions module](positions/position_module_spec.md) manages trading positions. It handles enrichment of positions with risk metrics, synchronization with external services, grouping for hedge analysis, and database persistence.

### Alerts
The [Alert module](alert_core/alert_module_spec.md) defines the lifecycle for alerts. It evaluates alert conditions, stores alert data, enriches values, and routes notifications.

### Portfolio
The [Portfolio position module](portfolio/position_module_spec.md) focuses on managing and updating position data within the portfolio. It exposes API endpoints, records snapshots, and triggers alert re-evaluation when positions change.

### Data
The [Sonic Data module](data/sonic_data_module_spec.md) defines the core data models and the DataLocker database layer used across the system. It provides persistence, schema management, and overall data integrity enforcement.

### Calculation Core
The [Calculation Core module](calc_core/calculation_module_spec.md) houses risk calculations and hedge utilities. It exposes pure math services, loads modifier weights, updates position metrics, and groups hedges for analysis.

### Hedge Core
The [Hedge Core module](hedge_core/hedge_core_module_spec.md) links long and short positions into hedge groups and aggregates their metrics.

### Monitor Core
The [Monitor module](monitor/monitor_module_spec.md) drives periodic tasks and health checks. It registers individual monitors and exposes CLI and API entrypoints for running them.

### Wallets
The [Wallet Core specification](wallets/wallet_core_spec.md) outlines wallet operations and blockchain helpers. The [Jupiter API spec](wallets/jupiter_api_spec.md) from **sonic_labs** describes how wallets interact with Jupiter Perps for managing collateral.

- `async run_link_hedges()` – detects hedge pairs using `CycloneHedgeService`.
- `async run_cleanse_ids()` – clears stale alerts from the datastore.

Each method logs progress with emojis and delegates to the appropriate service or core module.

## 🧩 Integrations
- **DataLocker** – provides persistence for alerts, prices, positions, and system variables.
- **AlertCore** – all alert creation and evaluation flows.
- **PositionCore** – position synchronization and enrichment.
- **MonitorCore** – optional monitoring callbacks during `run_cycle`.
- **Flask API** – `cyclone_bp.py` exposes HTTP endpoints that call into the same run methods.
- **Console** – `cyclone_console` offers an interactive menu using the `rich` library.

## ✅ Design Notes
- Steps are asynchronous and can be executed individually or as a full cycle.
- Centralized logging tags each message with the Cyclone source for clarity.
- Error handling in `run_cycle` emits "death" events through `SystemCore` when a step fails fatally.
- The architecture keeps services thin so logic is reusable in both CLI and API contexts.

3.2 DataLocker Class Overview
Singleton Pattern:
The class implements a singleton design via the get_instance() method to ensure only one database connection is active at any time.

Connection Management:

Uses SQLite with check_same_thread=False to allow multi-threaded access.

Initializes the connection in WAL mode to enhance performance and concurrency.

Error Handling & Logging:

Comprehensive error handling for all CRUD operations.

Uses Python’s logging framework to record both debug and error messages.

3.3 Core Methods
Price Operations
insert_price(price_dict)
Inserts a new price record. If fields like id or timestamps are missing, defaults are assigned.

get_prices(asset_type=None) / read_prices()
Retrieves price records, optionally filtered by asset type.

get_latest_price(asset_type)
Fetches the most recent price record for the specified asset type.

delete_price(price_id)
Deletes a price record by its identifier.

update_price(price_id, current_price, last_update_time)
Updates the current price and update timestamp.

Alert Operations
create_alert(alert_obj)
Inserts a new alert after normalizing and initializing default fields.

get_alert(alert_id) / get_alerts()
Retrieves one or more alert records.

update_alert_conditions(alert_id, update_fields)
Updates specified fields of an alert.

update_alert_status(alert_id, new_status)
Changes the status of an alert.

delete_alert(alert_id)
Deletes an alert by its identifier.

create_alert_instance(alert_obj)
A helper method to create an alert using an object’s dictionary representation.

Position Operations
create_position(pos_dict)
Inserts a new trading position record, ensuring all required defaults are set (e.g., auto-generating an ID).

get_positions() / read_positions()
Retrieves all position records.

delete_position(position_id) / delete_all_positions()
Deletes specific or all position records.

update_position_size(position_id, new_size) / update_position(position_id, size, collateral)
Updates size and collateral values for a position.

Wallet & Broker Operations
Wallet Methods:

read_wallets(), update_wallet(wallet_name, wallet_dict), create_wallet(wallet_dict), get_wallet_by_name(wallet_name)
Purpose: Manage crypto wallet records.

Broker Methods:

create_broker(broker_dict), read_brokers()
Purpose: Manage broker-related data.

Portfolio and System Variables
Portfolio Snapshots:

add_portfolio_entry(entry), get_portfolio_entries(), record_positions_totals_snapshot(totals)
Purpose: Record and retrieve snapshots of overall portfolio value and positions.

System Variables:

set_strategy_performance_data(start_value, description), get_strategy_performance_data()

set_last_update_times(...), get_last_update_times()
Purpose: Manage update timestamps, strategy performance data, and balance aggregates.

4. Validations & Constraints
Price Validations:

current_price must be > 0.

previous_price must be ≥ 0.

previous_update_time (if provided) must not exceed last_update_time.

Position Validations:

travel_percent is strictly enforced to lie between -11500 and 1000.

Alert Normalization:

The alert type is normalized (e.g., removing spaces, converting to uppercase) to ensure consistency.

Default values are assigned if certain fields are missing.

Database Integrity:

Unique constraints are enforced on primary keys (e.g., id for prices, positions, and alerts; name for brokers and wallets).

Transactions are used to ensure atomicity of operations.

5. Additional Considerations
Logging & Debugging:
Extensive logging is built into the DataLocker to facilitate debugging and traceability of operations.

Concurrency:
By configuring SQLite in WAL mode and allowing multithreaded access (check_same_thread=False), the module supports concurrent database operations.

Configuration:
The database path is configured via a constant (DB_PATH from config_constants), allowing for flexible deployment.

Extensibility:
The system is designed to easily accommodate new data models, additional alert types, or extended functionalities (such as enhanced risk metrics or migration support).

6. Usage & Integration
Importing Models:
Use models.py to instantiate objects for prices, alerts, positions, hedges, wallets, and brokers.

Database Operations:
Use DataLocker.get_instance() to obtain a singleton instance of the DataLocker. Then, utilize the provided CRUD methods to interact with the SQLite database.

Error Handling:
Ensure to catch and log exceptions from DataLocker methods to handle any database or integrity issues gracefully.

This specification provides a detailed look at your Data Module / Subsystem, outlining the data structures, validations, and database interactions that form the backbone of your trading or monitoring system. Let me know if you need any more details or refinements, honey!

## 📂 Module Structure

```txt
hedge_core/
├── hedge_core.py  # 🔗 Builds and links hedges
```

### 🔗 `HedgeCore`
Central orchestrator that creates, links, and fetches hedge objects.

```python
HedgeCore(data_locker)
```
- `data_locker`: instance of `DataLocker` providing DB access and helper managers.

**Key Methods**
- `update_hedges()` – orchestrates linking and building hedges from live positions.
- `build_hedges(positions=None) -> List[Hedge]` – converts position records into `Hedge` objects grouped by `hedge_buddy_id`.
- `link_hedges() -> List[list]` – scans current positions and assigns a shared UUID to long/short pairs.
- `unlink_hedges()` – clears all `hedge_buddy_id` values in the database.
- `get_modifiers(group=None) -> dict` – returns hedge/heat modifiers via `DLModifierManager`.
- `get_db_hedges() -> List[Hedge]` – retrieves persisted hedges using `DLHedgeManager`.

### 🗂️ Data Flow
1. `update_hedges()` logs the refresh, invokes `HedgeManager.find_hedges()` and builds results. 【F:hedge_core/hedge_core.py†L24-L41】
2. `build_hedges()` groups positions by `hedge_buddy_id`, aggregates sizes and heat indices, and returns a list of `Hedge` objects. 【F:hedge_core/hedge_core.py†L43-L89】
3. `link_hedges()` iterates positions grouped by `(wallet_name, asset_type)` and assigns a UUID when both long and short types are present. 【F:hedge_core/hedge_core.py†L91-L118】
4. `unlink_hedges()` performs a bulk SQL update to remove links. 【F:hedge_core/hedge_core.py†L121-L129】

### ✅ Design Notes
- All logging is handled through the shared logger injected via `core.core_imports`. 【F:hedge_core/hedge_core.py†L24-L129】
- Hedge detection relies solely on wallet/asset pairs and does not consider leverage or size weighting in this implementation.
- `get_modifiers()` provides a simple pass-through to the data layer so external callers can inspect weighting factors.
- Hedge IDs mirror the `hedge_buddy_id` used to link positions ensuring stable lookups across API calls.

- If `registry` is not provided, a new one is created and default monitors are registered (`PriceMonitor`, `PositionMonitor`, `OperationsMonitor`).

**Methods**
- `run_all()` – iterate and run every monitor in the registry, logging success or failure.
- `run_by_name(name)` – run a single monitor by its key if present.

### 🧩 Monitor Implementations
- **BaseMonitor** – provides `run_cycle()` wrapper that records results in the database ledger.
- **PriceMonitor** – fetches BTC/ETH/SOL prices via `MonitorService`.
- **PositionMonitor** – syncs positions from Jupiter and logs summary metrics.
- **OperationsMonitor** – runs POST tests on startup and stores results.
- **LatencyMonitor** – optional HTTP latency checker for third-party services.

### 🌐 API & Background Runner
- `monitor_api.py` exposes REST endpoints to trigger monitors individually or all at once.
- `sonic_monitor.py` runs periodic cycles using `Cyclone` and records a heartbeat in the database.

### ✅ Design Notes
- Monitors write a summary entry to the ledger table via `DataLocker.ledger`.
- Registration through `MonitorRegistry` keeps monitor setup centralized.
- Execution paths include CLI scripts, Flask API, and long‑running background loops.

Position Module/Subsystem Specification
1. Overview
The Position Module is responsible for managing trading position data throughout its lifecycle. It retrieves raw positions from persistent storage, enriches them with computed analytics (such as profit, leverage, travel percent, heat index, etc.), updates positions by integrating with external APIs (like Jupiter and dYdX), and handles deletion and archival (snapshot recording) of positions. It also supports the grouping of positions for hedge analysis and facilitates real-time updates via web endpoints.

2. Scope
Data Retrieval: Read raw position records from the database.

Data Enrichment: Compute and update metrics (profit, leverage, travel percent, heat index, liquidation distance) using defined formulas and external data (e.g., latest market prices).

Position Updates: Synchronize positions with external trading APIs (Jupiter, dYdX).

Data Persistence: Update the enriched position records back into the database and record periodic snapshots for trend analysis.

Alerts Integration: Trigger re-evaluation of alerts based on updated positions.

Web API Endpoints: Expose position-related operations (list, update, delete, trends, mobile view, etc.) via a Flask blueprint.

Hedge Analysis: Identify and group positions for potential hedging opportunities.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Position Retrieval and Enrichment
Get All Positions:

Retrieve raw positions via the DataLocker interface.

Enrich each position record by computing:

Profit: Based on the position size and price difference.

Leverage: Calculated as size divided by collateral.

Travel Percent: Determined using entry, current, and liquidation prices.

Liquidation Distance: The absolute difference between the current price and liquidation price.

Heat Index: A composite risk metric derived from position size, leverage, and collateral.

Update each position’s current_price field by fetching the latest market price from persistent storage.

3.2 Position Updates from External APIs
Jupiter API Integration:

Delete existing Jupiter positions (based on wallet name) prior to an update.

Fetch new position data from Jupiter’s API, map fields to the internal model, and avoid duplicates.

Update the database with new positions.

dYdX API Integration:

Retrieve positions from dYdX, format data accordingly, and insert new records if they do not already exist.

3.3 Position Modification and Deletion
Edit Position:

Allow updates to fields like size and collateral via web forms.

Delete Single Position:

Remove a position record from the database by its unique identifier.

Delete All Positions:

Provide an endpoint for bulk deletion of all position records (typically for administrative or reset purposes).

3.4 Snapshot and Trend Analysis
Record Positions Snapshot:

Aggregate key metrics (total size, value, collateral, average leverage, etc.) using CalcServices.

Persist snapshots into a history table for future trend analysis.

Trend Reporting:

Expose endpoints that allow users to view historical trends over selectable time frames (e.g., last 24 hours).

3.5 Hedge Analysis
Find Hedges:

Analyze current positions to identify potential hedges by grouping positions (long and short) by asset and wallet.

Return aggregated hedge metrics for display or further analysis.

3.6 Web API Endpoints
Positions Blueprint:

Endpoints include listing positions, detailed table views, mobile-friendly views, editing, deletion, and data APIs.

Sorting, filtering, and grouping functionalities are provided at the UI level.

SocketIO Integration:

Emit events upon position updates to notify connected clients in real time.

4. Data Model
4.1 Position Data (from models.py)
A Position record includes:

Identifiers: id (UUID), wallet_name

Asset Details: asset_type (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL)

Trading Data: entry_price, liquidation_price, current_price

Metrics:

Travel Percent: The percentage movement from the entry toward a profit target or liquidation.

Profit/Value: Computed profit added to collateral.

Collateral & Size: Financial inputs for leverage.

Leverage: Calculated ratio (size / collateral).

Heat Index: Composite risk index.

Liquidation Distance: Absolute difference between current and liquidation prices.

Relationships:[cyclone.py](../cyclone/cyclone_engine.py)

alert_reference_id for associated alerts.

hedge_buddy_id for positions grouped in hedges.

Timestamps: last_updated

4.2 Other Models
Alert Model: For linking positions to alerts (used for re-evaluation after position updates).

Hedge Model: Represents grouped positions for hedging analysis.

Wallet Model: Stores wallet information (used for associating positions with specific wallets).

5. Interfaces and Dependencies
5.1 Internal Modules
PositionService (position_service.py):

Offers static and instance methods for retrieving, enriching, updating, and deleting positions.

CalcServices (calc_services.py):

Provides calculation logic for travel percent, heat index, leverage, and risk metrics.

DataLocker (data_locker.py):

Manages all database interactions, including reading/writing positions, prices, and snapshots.

Alerts Module:

Integrates with the AlertEvaluator to update alerts based on changes in positions.

5.2 External Dependencies
External APIs:

Jupiter API and dYdX API for fetching real-time position data.

Flask Framework:

Positions endpoints are exposed via a Flask blueprint.

SocketIO:

Real-time notifications for updates to positions.

SQLite Database:

Used as the underlying persistent storage mechanism.

6. Error Handling and Logging
Robust Exception Management:

Each method catches and logs exceptions using the built-in logger or UnifiedLogger.

API endpoints return structured JSON error messages along with appropriate HTTP status codes.

Database Transaction Safety:

Updates and deletions are wrapped in commits with rollback mechanisms on errors.

Logging:

Detailed debug logs are generated at key points (e.g., before and after enrichment, during API updates, and during database transactions) to facilitate troubleshooting.

7. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The module leverages batch updates and efficient querying via SQLite. Asynchronous processing is used for API calls and heavy computations where applicable.

Extensibility:

The design allows for easy integration of additional asset types, new calculation methods, and support for more external APIs.

Maintainability:

Code is modularized into clear components (service, persistence, calculations, and web endpoints) for easier maintenance and updates.

Usability:

Exposed web interfaces (HTML views, JSON APIs) and real-time updates via SocketIO improve user experience.

Scalability:

While built on SQLite, the architecture can be scaled to other database systems with minimal modifications to the DataLocker interface.

8. Assumptions and Constraints
Singleton Pattern:

DataLocker is used as a singleton to ensure consistent database access across modules.

External Configuration:

Critical parameters (such as API keys, wallet addresses, thresholds for calculations, and logging levels) are managed via configuration files.

Data Consistency:

It is assumed that external API data is consistent and that appropriate validations (such as ensuring non-zero collateral) are enforced in calculation methods.

Thread Safety:

Database connections are managed with SQLite’s WAL mode and thread-check disablement, though caution is advised in multi-threaded environments.\n---\n

# File: positions/position_core_detailed_spec.md
# Position Core Detailed Specification

## Overview

The `PositionCore` module orchestrates position management, enrichment, synchronization, and snapshotting. It relies on the `DataLocker` data layer for persistent storage and shared services.  This specification documents the behavior of `PositionCore`, its interaction with subordinate services (`PositionStore`, `PositionEnrichmentService`, `PositionSyncService`, and `HedgeManager`), and the responsibilities of the data layer components it uses.

## Module Relationships

```
PositionCore
 ├─ PositionStore             → wrappers around DataLocker.positions
 ├─ PositionEnrichmentService → uses CalculationCore and DataLocker.prices
 ├─ PositionSyncService       → fetches from Jupiter API, inserts via DataLocker
 └─ HedgeManager              → pure in‑memory hedge detection
DataLocker
 ├─ DatabaseManager           → SQLite wrapper
 ├─ DLPositionManager         → CRUD for `positions` table
 ├─ DLPortfolioManager        → records portfolio snapshots
 ├─ DLSystemDataManager       → stores system vars (update times, theme, etc.)
 └─ other managers (alerts, prices, wallets, …)
```

`PositionCore` receives a `DataLocker` instance at construction and passes it to all sub‑components. Because `DataLocker` holds an open connection to the SQLite database, all position operations ultimately go through `DLPositionManager`.

## DataLocker Schema

The relevant schema for positions is created in `DataLocker.initialize_database()`:

```python
# data/data_locker.py
130  "positions": """
131      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS positions (
132          id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
133          asset_type TEXT,
134          position_type TEXT,
135          entry_price REAL,
136          liquidation_price REAL,
137          travel_percent REAL,
138          value REAL,
139          collateral REAL,
140          size REAL,
141          leverage REAL,
142          wallet_name TEXT,
143          last_updated TEXT,
144          alert_reference_id TEXT,
145          hedge_buddy_id TEXT,
146          current_price REAL,
147          liquidation_distance REAL,
148          heat_index REAL,
149          current_heat_index REAL,
150          pnl_after_fees_usd REAL
151      )
"""
```

This table stores every imported or manually created position. `DLPositionManager` operates on this table.

Additional tables used by `PositionCore` workflows:

- `positions_totals_history` for snapshots (`DLPortfolioManager.record_snapshot`).
- `system_vars` where last update timestamps are kept (`DLSystemDataManager`).

## `PositionCore` Class

### Construction

```python
# positions/position_core.py
13 class PositionCore:
14     def __init__(self, data_locker):
15         self.dl = data_locker
16         self.store = PositionStore(data_locker)
17         self.enricher = PositionEnrichmentService(data_locker)
```

Upon instantiation, `PositionCore` keeps a reference to the provided `DataLocker` and initializes two helpers:

- `PositionStore` – thin wrapper over `DLPositionManager` for CRUD operations.
- `PositionEnrichmentService` – calculates leverage, travel percent, heat index, and injects live prices.

### Basic CRUD

```python
19 def get_all_positions(self):
20     return self.store.get_all_positions()

22 def get_active_positions(self):
23     return self.store.get_active_positions()

25 def create_position(self, pos: dict):
26     enriched = self.enricher.enrich(pos)
27     return self.store.insert(enriched)

29 def delete_position(self, pos_id: str):
30     return self.store.delete(pos_id)

32 def clear_all_positions(self):
33     self.store.delete_all()
```

- `get_all_positions()` fetches all rows via `PositionStore.get_all()`, which calls `DataLocker.positions.get_all_positions()`.
- `create_position()` enriches the provided dictionary then inserts it via `DLPositionManager.create_position()`.
- `delete_position()` and `clear_all_positions()` map to `DLPositionManager.delete_position` and `DLPositionManager.delete_all_positions` respectively.

### Snapshot Recording

```python
35 def record_snapshot(self):
36     try:
37         raw = self.store.get_all()
38         totals = CalcServices().calculate_totals(raw)
39         self.dl.portfolio.record_snapshot(totals)
40         log.success("📸 Position snapshot recorded", source="PositionCore")
41     except Exception as e:
42         log.error(f"❌ Snapshot recording failed: {e}", source="PositionCore")
```

Snapshots summarize all positions into aggregate metrics and store them using `DLPortfolioManager.record_snapshot`. The `CalcServices.calculate_totals()` utility computes totals (size, value, collateral) plus averages such as leverage and heat index. The resulting data is persisted in `positions_totals_history`.

### Jupiter Synchronization

```python
44 def update_positions_from_jupiter(self, source="console"):
49     from positions.position_sync_service import PositionSyncService
50     sync_service = PositionSyncService(self.dl)
51     return sync_service.run_full_jupiter_sync(source=source)
```

This delegates to `PositionSyncService`. During a full sync the service:
1. Calls `update_jupiter_positions()` to fetch wallet positions from the Jupiter API and insert them into the database via `DLPositionManager.create_position`.
2. Generates hedges with `HedgeManager`.
3. Updates timestamps in `system_vars` with `DLSystemDataManager.set_last_update_times`.
4. Records a portfolio snapshot using `DLPortfolioManager`.

### Hedge Linking

```python
53 def link_hedges(self):
57     log.banner("🔗 Generating Hedges via PositionCore")
60     positions = self.store.get_all()
63     hedge_manager = HedgeManager(positions)
64     hedges = hedge_manager.get_hedges()
66     log.success("✅ Hedge generation complete", source="PositionCore", payload={"hedge_count": len(hedges)})
67     return hedges
```

`HedgeManager` analyzes in‑memory positions to pair long and short exposures. The resulting hedge records are not persisted by `PositionCore` directly but may be inserted via other DataLocker utilities if required.

### Enrichment of Existing Positions

```python
73 async def enrich_positions(self):
78     log.banner("🧠 Enriching All Positions via PositionCore")
81     raw = self.store.get_all()
82     enriched = []
83     failed = []
85     for pos in raw:
87         enriched_pos = self.enricher.enrich(pos)
89         if validate_enriched_position(enriched_pos, source="EnrichmentValidator"):
90             enriched.append(enriched_pos)
91         else:
92             failed.append(enriched_pos.get("id"))
97     log.success("✅ Position enrichment complete", source="PositionCore", payload={"enriched": len(enriched), "failed": len(failed)})
102     if failed:
103         log.warning("⚠️ Some positions failed enrichment validation", source="PositionCore", payload={"invalid_ids": failed})
107     return enriched
```

This method reloads all positions, enriches each using `PositionEnrichmentService`, validates them, and returns the enriched list (without writing back to the database). Failures are logged for review.

## `PositionStore`

`PositionStore` is a very small wrapper around `DLPositionManager`. Key methods:

```python
11 class PositionStore:
15     def get_all(self) -> list:
17         rows = self.dl.positions.get_all_positions()

27 def get_active_positions(self) -> list:
29     cursor = self.dl.db.get_cursor()
30     cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM positions WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'")
31     rows = cursor.fetchall()

41 def insert(self, position: dict) -> bool:
45     self.dl.positions.create_position(position)

52 def delete(self, pos_id: str) -> bool:
54     self.dl.positions.delete_position(pos_id)

61 def delete_all(self):
63     self.dl.positions.delete_all_positions()
```

Because `DataLocker` already exposes `DLPositionManager`, `PositionStore` mainly adds logging and default fields.

## `DLPositionManager`

The data layer implementation for positions resides here. Highlights:

- **Defaults & Sanitization** – `create_position()` inserts defaults for all missing fields before writing to the database and strips any keys not present in the schema. [`data/dl_positions.py` lines 33‑71]【F:data/dl_positions.py†L33-L71】
- **Retrieval** – `get_all_positions()` returns a list of dictionaries for all rows. [`data/dl_positions.py` lines 109‑118]【F:data/dl_positions.py†L109-L118】
- **Deletion** – `delete_position()` and `delete_all_positions()` remove rows from the table. [`data/dl_positions.py` lines 124‑142]【F:data/dl_positions.py†L124-L142】
- **Snapshots** – `record_positions_totals_snapshot()` persists aggregate metrics to `positions_totals_history`. [`data/dl_positions.py` lines 152‑176】

## Data Flow Example

Creating a position via `PositionCore.create_position()` proceeds as follows:

1. Caller supplies a basic position dictionary.
2. `PositionEnrichmentService.enrich()` computes derived fields such as leverage, heat index, and injects current market price via `DataLocker.prices.get_latest_price`.
3. The enriched dictionary is passed to `PositionStore.insert()`.
4. `PositionStore` calls `DLPositionManager.create_position()` which ensures defaults, sanitizes fields against the schema, constructs the SQL insert, and commits to SQLite.
5. Success is logged at each stage via the centralized logger.

## Snapshot Lifecycle

When `record_snapshot()` is invoked:

1. All positions are loaded from the database.
2. `CalcServices.calculate_totals()` computes totals and averages.
3. `DLPortfolioManager.record_snapshot()` writes these aggregates to `positions_totals_history` with a timestamp.
4. The operation is logged as a success or failure.

## Timestamp Management

`PositionSyncService` and other callers use `DataLocker.system.set_last_update_times()` to record when data was last refreshed. The `system_vars` table holds fields such as `last_update_time_positions`, `last_update_time_jupiter`, and their corresponding source labels. This ensures UI components can display the freshness of data.

## Error Handling & Logging

Throughout the module stack, errors are caught and logged with the same console logger (`core.logging`). Failures to write to the database are logged both to the console and, in the case of `DLPositionManager.create_position`, to a persistent log file (`logs/dl_failed_inserts.log`) so that problematic payloads can be inspected later.

## Summary

`PositionCore` is the high‑level API for anything related to trading positions. It delegates storage to `DataLocker`’s managers and uses enrichment logic to ensure positions carry calculated metrics. By combining synchronization, enrichment, hedge detection, and snapshotting, it provides a single entry point for the rest of the application (Flask routes, console tools, and monitoring engine) to manage position data in a consistent manner.
